What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder inside any existing directory  containing files, or a new directory. It shows the number of untracked files present in the directory.
We need to initialize a respository so that we can start tracking changes to our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository. It shows files that will be committed when we do a git commit. It gives us an idea of the files that will be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Staging aread gives a view of what files have changed as compared to the most recent commit. This will help us to add or remove files from the staging area so that we ensure we have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when we want to try out some experimental features keeping the master branch intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps determine reachability, every branch only shows the commits that it can trace back. Each commit that we make has a parent reference to the previous commit of the branch. If suppose we checkout a particular commit, and commit some changes on top of it, that commit will be lost since it can't be tracked from any of the branches. In such situations, its better to create a new branch with that commit, and make changes on top of it.
