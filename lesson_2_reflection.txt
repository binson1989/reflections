What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git folder inside any existing directory  containing files, or a new directory. It shows the number of untracked files present in the directory.
We need to initialize a respository so that we can start tracking changes to our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository. It shows files that will be committed when we do a git commit. It gives us an idea of the files that will be committed.
