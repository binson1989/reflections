When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository will allow working on our repository from any device, anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually gives us more control over what changes to take in and also in resolving conflicts if any.
