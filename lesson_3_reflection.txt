When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository will allow working on our repository from any device, anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually gives us more control over what changes to take in and also in resolving conflicts if any.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forking is done to clone someone's repository onto our github account directly. Then we can clone our forked repository and make changes and push them to our forked repository. This is primarily done because we do not have permission to make changes to that someone's repository.
Cloning is done to make a clone of a repository either existing in github or locally as well. It also gets the entire commit history as well alongwith it.
Branching is done when we want to try out some features without hampering the master production branch.
